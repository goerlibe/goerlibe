### Hi there, I am Bertin ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently studying Informatik M.Sc. at TU Darmstadt. I also worked there as a research assistant where I was involved in the development of [DiscoPoP](https://www.discopop.tu-darmstadt.de/)
- ðŸŒ± Studying is soooo theoretical. I want to get involved in some more practical work and am currently open for job offers.
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time I dance, play, read and teach Ving Tsun Kung Fu to kids. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to create an issue in this repository.
