### Hi there, I am Bertin ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently studying Information Science at TU Darmstadt. I also work there as a research assistant where I am involved in the development of [DiscoPoP](https://www.discopop.tu-darmstadt.de/)
- ðŸŒ± Studying is soooo theoretical. Therefore I am currently looking for a job that could help me find out what to do with all this theoretical knowledge and get some practical experience.
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time I dance, play, read and teach Ving Tsun Kunf Fu to kids. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to create an issue in this repository.
